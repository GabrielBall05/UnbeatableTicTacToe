OVERVIEW:
  This is a 1-person Tac Tac Toe game against the computer.
  You have the option to go first, let the AI go first, or a coin toss.
  You will have the option to play again at the end of the game.
  Just so you know, you will never beat the AI. The best you can do is draw.
  If you typo, you will be asked to re-enter your decision.
RULES:
  Regular Tic Tac Toe rules, 3 in a row wins (row, column, or diagonal).
  You will be X, the AI will be O.
  You cannot choose a spot that is already taken.
  If you do, you will be asked to choose a new spot.
  Again, you can choose who goes first or for a coin toss (50/50).
ABOUT:
  This program uses a Mini-Max Algorithm to decide the best possible move for the AI to make.
  It does not have Alpha-Beta Pruning, but Tic Tac Toe is a small board, so it is very fast.
  I have it wait a moment before showing the AI's move so you can see what is going on.
